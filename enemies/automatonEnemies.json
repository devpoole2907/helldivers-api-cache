        "description": "As the primary infantry unit of the Automaton forces, the Trooper is a fundamental component of the enemy lineup. This unit, while basic, can be deployed in large numbers and equipped with a variety of weapons and equipment based on mission needs. Often considered cannon fodder due to their vulnerability in small groups, Troopers are nonetheless crucial targets because of their ability to call in heavier reinforcements.",

Enhanced with advanced processing and basic command algorithms, it orchestrates troop movements while avoiding direct combat. Despite its non-sentient nature, the Commissar is essential for coordinating Automaton infantry squads.",

This highlights the Automatons' nature as nothing more than copycats and thieves. In contrast, a single skilled Helldiver can dismantle these tanks, while Super Earth's versions can decimate entire platoons.",
