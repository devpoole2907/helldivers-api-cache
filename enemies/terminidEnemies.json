        "description": "The Scavenger, an adolescent form of the Warrior, sits at the bottom of the Terminid food chain and is ubiquitous across various planets and difficulty levels.\nThough individually weak and largely harmless, Scavengers can become surprisingly dangerous when encountered in packs. A Helldiver caught amidst a group of these creatures may find them more threatening than initially anticipated. Additionally, if given the opportunity, Scavengers can release a cloud of Pheromone Spores, signaling the presence of hostiles to other nearby Terminids.",

On Extreme difficulty and higher, Bile Spewers gain the capability to launch a mortar-like volley of bile into the air, significantly enhancing their range and lethality.",
